# **Parking Places Counter**

This mini project was implemented following Murtaza Hassan's instructions. With this simple tool you can count parking spaces live on video footage using only openCV and image processing. If you have any video footage of a parking lot from a stable camera, you can easily adapt this code which is just a basis.

#### To use:
- git clone <this_url>
- install (the only one requirement) : -pip install cvzone
- python main.py

You will see the detector running on the sample video in a pop up window
